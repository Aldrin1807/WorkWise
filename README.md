# WorkWise
WorkWise is a job searching platform developed as a university project. It is built using React and focuses on the frontend aspect of the application. Please note that the page is not functionally complete, but it serves as a demonstration of the user interface and features.

## Project Overview
WorkWise aims to provide a user-friendly platform for job seekers and employers to connect. While the page does not have full functionality, it showcases the key features and flow of the application.
### Key Features
- Job Listings: Users can browse job listings without the need to log in. They can view job details, such as the title, description, and requirements.
- User Registration: To apply for a job or access additional features, users must create an account. They can register as either an employee or a job seeker.
- Job Seeker Features: Job seekers have the ability to apply for jobs, view a list of jobs they have applied to, and update their profile information. They can also add academic information, skills, and other relevant details to enhance their profile.
- Employer Features: Employers can post job listings, view a list of jobs they have posted, and access the details of applicants who have applied for their jobs. Employers also have settings to manage their company information.
